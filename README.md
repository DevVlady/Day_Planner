# Day_Planner

#   About my Daily Planner
   * This is a planner that displays all hours of the work week.
   * I use this planner as to log tasks throughout the day.
   * At the top I have the current date of which i am working on where i can input and tasks/todo's.

# How this planner works and how to use it
* This planner has time slots from 9am to 5pm
* As the time throughout the day passes each time (present, past and future) will display a different color making it easier to read.
* Present time will be displayed in red, future will display in green, and past will be displayed in grey.
* Each time slot will have a an input field where the user will have the option to type in tasks, meetings etc they want to track throughout the day.
* On the right side of each time slot, there is a save button which will allow the user to save their tasks once they type them in and hit save. The tasks will then be saved and stored unless one makes changes and saves those current changes. The old task will then be overwritten.
* All events and tasks that have been saved will remain even when the refresh button of the webpage is clicked on.
